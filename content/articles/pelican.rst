:summary: Describing my experience setting up this website with Pelican

I just set up this website with Pelican, a static site generator, on Github Pages.
It's rather easy to use, although it has its quirks. I'll walk you through 
the entire process.

First of all, if you're thinking about setting up a site with 
`Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/stable/>`_,
you may want to think about alternatives. Notably, Jekyll builds on Ruby and it is
very well supported by Github itself. Other choices include Octopress (originally
built onto Jekyll to add features and simplicity, now a framework of its own),
Hexo (NodeJS) or Hugo (Golang). 

Ultimately, I chose Pelican because I have some experience with Python
and thought this may ease the configuration and maintainance. 
If you would prefer something else, you can find static site generators for just 
about any (interpreted) language.

Either way, the language doesn't really matter. The point of a static site
generator is to just write markup and have the site ready. But you may
feel more confortable customizing some things like the theme in your language.

Keep in mind that if you feel like migrating to another static site generator,
you just have to prepare the new boilerplate and migrate the content, which
should be relatively painless. So whatever you choose, you can't go wrong.

Installing and setting up
-------------------------

Basically, I started by installing Pelican using:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install pelican

`The official guide <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.7.1/install.html>`_ advises 
setting up a virtalenv and installing through pip but it will probably work 
fine for you without that.

After that, I started a new website with ``pelican-quickstart``. This sets up the folder
tree, as well as some files for the generator. Your folder will look like this::

    yourproject/
    ├── content
    │   └── (pages)
    ├── output
    ├── develop_server.sh
    ├── fabfile.py
    ├── Makefile
    ├── pelicanconf.py       # Main settings file
    └── publishconf.py       # Settings to use when ready to publish

Note in particular pelicanconf.py. This is the most important file and it controls just
about every setting of your website, as we'll see later on.

Now, you should create content/pages/about.rst and write some hello world.
Then, run ``make devserver`` in the project's root folder (this is a very
handy script that regenerates your website after every change and keeps it
deployed and serving).
You should now be able to browse your site at http://localhost:8000/.

Format
------

At this point, you will want to decide what kind of markup tool you want to use
in order to write your articles. Pelican supports two formats:

* Markdown (.md): The consensus online seems to be that Markdown is well supported 
  accross many platforms but is a loosely-defined standard. This may lead to some 
  inconsistencies and quirks but an otherwise smoother experience.
* reStrcturedText, on the other hand, is a well-defined standard with one large 
  implementation, Python Sphinx. It is however much less commonplace and
  sometimes more verbose, so you will find some missing features. 
  Note that Python's own docutils use rST.

Ultimately, these criteria didn't matter to me so I went ahead with Pelican's 
default format, which is rST. For the moment.

Note that writing anything that the rST parser doesn't like
in the markup may crash the ``make devserver``, and you 
will have to run the command again after fixing the mistake, which is annoying.

You can find a more in-depth discussion of the subject of markup formats in Python
`here <https://coderwall.com/p/vemncg/what-is-the-difference-rest-docutils-sphinx-readthedocs>`_

Themes
-------

The default Pelican theme, simply named ``theme``, looks alright, but not quite
good. You can find many themes on the 
`pelican-themes repo <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/>`_.
I picked pelican-bootstrap, which is based on Twitter Bootstrap 3 and allows you to
import thousands of Bootstrap themes.

Setting up a Pelican theme is simple: download it from Github, put it in a 
``pelican-themes`` folder within the project root, then point to it from 
within ``pelicanconf.py`` using in this example:

.. code-block:: python

    THEME = "pelican-themes/pelican-bootstrap3"

Furthermore, because this theme supports internationalization (i18n), you have
to enable the i18n Pelican plugin in pelicanconf.py, like so:

.. code-block:: python

  PLUGIN_PATHS = ['pelican-plugins']
  PLUGINS = ['i18n_subsites']
  JINJA_ENVIRONMENT = {
    'extensions': ['jinja2.ext.i18n']
  }

For the bootstrap-theme, pick one on one of the many websites featuring them, 
notably `Bootswatch <https://bootswatch.com/>`_ 
or `StartBootstrap <https://startbootstrap.com/>`_.

The themes on Bootswatch already come with pelican-bootstrap3, under static/css.
You can apply any bootstrap-(theme).[min.].css by adding 
``BOOTSTRAP_THEME = "darkly"`` to your pelicanconf.py.

Static files
------------

I recommend you create an additional folder named ``extra`` inside the content 
folder, where you will place files that you want to later transfer to specific 
locations within your site. This includes, among others:

* Favicons
* robots.txt
* CNAME if you use Github pages with a custom domain like me
* README.txt

You then have to specify each path in pelicanconf.py so that Pelican
knows what to do with them, for example:

.. code-block:: python

  STATIC_PATHS = [
    'images', 
    'extra/robots.txt'
  ]
  EXTRA_PATH_METADATA = {
    'extra/robots.txt': {'path': 'robots.txt'}
  }

Disqus
------

In order to generate the Disqus section at the bottom of each article, 
you must first have a Disqus account. You can open one that is free 
for personal use or organizations. Just try to do it before uploading,
as it's rather annoying to have it load every time you refresh while writing.

After creating an account, specify ``DISQUS_SITENAME = '[site name]'`` in pelicanconf.py. 
That should do it (except if you use pelican-bootstrap3.  It will probably not work and 
you will have to follow 
`this <https://github.com/DandyDev/pelican-bootstrap3/issues/219#issuecomment-129460703>`_).

Plugins
-------

Pelican has quite the variety of plugins. You can find a lot of them on
the `pelican-plugins <https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins>`_ repo.
Notably editors, fields and various automation plugins.

Deploying to Github Pages
-------------------------

Using Github Pages with Pelican is nice, and it's free.

First of all, you have to create the repo that will contain your website.
Since you probably intend to use Github user pages, you have to create your
user repo with the repo name "[Github user].github.io". 
Then you have to configure it under your repo's settings to use:

.. image:: images/pelican-experience/configure-ghpages.png
  :alt: configuring gh pages

After that, anytime you want to deploy the output folder to your site, you
may run these commands from the site root:

.. code-block:: bash

  ghp-import output
  git push -f git@github.com:[Github user]/[Github user].github.io.git gh-pages:master

This copies the output folder to the gh-pages branch, then pushes it to the
master branch of your user pages repo.

Custom domain
-------------

If you intend to use a custom domain, you must first direct it to your Github Pages:

.. image:: images/pelican-experience/ghpages-custom-domain.png
  :alt: ghpages custom domain

Then you should enter your custom domain in your repo's settings,
as shown `above <#deploying-to-github-pages>`_. Finally, you will
need to create a file named CNAME which contains just your domain name, as Github's
`guide <https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-subdomain/>`_ says.
You can use a `static file <#static-files>`_ for this. Or you could install 
`this plugin <https://github.com/MinchinWeb/minchin.pelican.plugins.cname>`_ to
automate it.
